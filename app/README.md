# Simple Django webserver

## Purpose
- Learning purposes only, will be messing around
- Good to be used as a template for future projects
- For purposes of this template/project, external SQL will not be used
    - SQLite or NoSQL only

## Commands
- Some commands to help extend this:
    - Run on localhost:8080 `python manage.py runserver 8080`
    - Run on public IP: `python manage.py runserver 0:80`
    (This is for IP:port, 0 is short for 0.0.0.0)
    - Create new sub app: `python manage.py startapp <name_here>`
